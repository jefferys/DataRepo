Description: This package helps manage a large (100+ TB) collection of data
    files. It only works on a unix-like file system (i.e. not on Windows) as it
    uses unix file system groups and permissions to manage data access. Access
    is not very granular, with read permission granted by membership in a file
    system group, the "read group" and write permission granted by membership in
    another group, the "write-group". This is currently in a very preliminary
    state and under active development. Don't count on API consistency across
    versions yet.
