Description: This package helps manage a large (100+ TB) collection of data
    files. It only works on a unix-like file system (i.e. not on Windows) as it
    uses unix file system groups and permissions to manage access. Access is not
    very granular, although read permission is separate from write/delete
    permission. This is currently in a very preliminary state and under active
    development. Don't count on API consistency across versions yet.
